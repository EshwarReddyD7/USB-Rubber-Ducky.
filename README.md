Creating a USB Rubber Ducky with a pendrive.
You cannot create a true USB Rubber Ducky using just a regular pen drive and Rufus, because standard USB drives do not have the capability to emulate a keyboard. A USB Rubber Ducky is a device that appears to a computer as a keyboard and rapidly types preprogrammed keystrokes to execute commands. Rufus is a tool used to create bootable USB drives, typically for installing operating systems, and does not provide HID (Human Interface Device) emulation. To create a functional USB Rubber Ducky, you need a device like a Hak5 Rubber Ducky, Digispark, or Arduino Pro Micro, which can emulate a keyboard and run scripts designed to perform automated attacks.
